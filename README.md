# Introduction

You should follow this design at:  https://www.figma.com/file/DlIiDA1AnaSAjCZYGgp7St/FE-Developer-Homework-(Solid-World)?node-id=1168%3A15718 

This codebase is setup based on what is our FE stack in Solid.
As you can see we use:

- React with Redux
- Javascript
- CSS, styled-components
- Ethers.js

It would be awesome if you complete this homework with this stack.

The Smart Contract you need to interact with is deployed at 0x00aBe16886439cEbA14d258326e814eA3790007f on Rinkeby network. The solidity source of it is at contracts/token.sol  
And the Ethereum wallet we will test the connection is Metamask.

Have fun and godspeed!
